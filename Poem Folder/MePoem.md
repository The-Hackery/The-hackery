# Me by LuqGod

I'm never the smartest person in the room.

Nor do I wanna be.

I kinda feel sad cause today seems to be a gloom.

I need some space.

Cause I got no room.

I need to think. 

I need to zoom.

Looking down to my feet so I could walk back to my room. 

That time is limited as people would say.
I dont know but I wish everyone is okay.
My brain is a computer that i don't know if i have enough cache.

I wanna be able to take a step back and just array. 
My gpa is gonna drop this semester with no hooray. 
Its been hard its been a frey.
But that doesn't mean i got no moments of gay. 
I got the internet i have access to the gateway. 
This bluejay i see on the freeway. 
Thinking bout success is all about eating some gourmet.
Living in a penthouse with some work with some leeway. 

I could wake up in the midday and just walk away. 
And yet get some money on my payday. 
I have to be lucky. 
I have to display.
I need to work hard, i need to outweigh. 
My problems on my plate gotta go  so i could make someway. 

The world we live in is unfair and there is no one in this world thats cares. 
I need to take care of me.
I need to take care of myself. 
I don't mean to be self fish nor do I mean to be an elf.
I just want to excel. 
I just want to perpel. 
living in hotels. 
Making some cash money with no stress as well. 
But that's not whats ringing on my doorbell.
I open that door and all i could see is myself. 
The only person that could change my world is myself. 
I found my passion.
I know what brings me back to this session.
I'm back to my grind, back to the present of time. 
I'm working hard.
I work to rhyme.
That i'm staying up late. 
I'm pass my bedtime. 
I can't sleep. 
Counting these sheeps aint no help cause this bed is so cheap.
I'm going down.
I'm going deep. 
Focus on work. 
Focus on the dream.
Focus on trying to learn. 
So that one day I could just earn. 

The fire in my chest is so hot that it burns. 
Sometimes it can be a concern. 
But I use it to flame my motivation to get some returns. 

Im about to turn this work I've been working on. 
For some self motivation. 
This way of cognition. 
Gives me some liberation for someone who is Malaysian.
The freedom to learn, the freedom to grow. 
That my own story is told by my own narration. 
This sansation. 
Makes me wanna work harder than Luqgod ever did for some. 
Self satisfaction. 
This dedication thatI have on myself is pushed for some inauguration. 
This initiation that I have was started by some ammense anger inflation. 
That I beat myself up, I let myself down, I shouldn't be doing this. 

I should focus on me. 
Be like the sea. 
Follow the flow and get that degree. 
You're here to be who you are. 
You found your passion.
You found your love.
Now chase your dream...
I believe in you.
And now you have to believe in yourself. 
I'm done lecturing. 
Now do what needs to be done.
